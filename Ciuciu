### Bug Report: Player Unable to Stand After Crouching in Specific Area

**Summary:**

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to [describe the area, e.g., "the warehouse basement" or "Area X"].
2. Press the CTRL key to crouch.
3. Try to press CTRL again to stand up.
4. Observe that the player remains in the crouched position and cannot stand until they move to the stairs.

**Expected Behavior:**
The player should be able to press the crouch (CTRL) key again to stand up in any area.

**Actual Behavior:**
Once crouched in the affected area, the player is unable to stand by pressing CTRL. The player remains stuck in the crouched position until they move to a staircase, which resets the crouch status.
