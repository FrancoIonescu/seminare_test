**Steps to Reproduce:**

**Actual Result:**

**Expected Result:**
The character should land normally inside or on the edges of the fabricator and be able to move freely without any issues.

**Workaround:**
To exit this state, the player must move the character to the side of the fabricator. This allows the character to break free from the invisible block.

**Game Impact:**
